            <ul className="rules-list">
                <div className="rule-item">
                    <p><b>Rest</b></p>
                    <p>Rest on your rest days. At most, do cardio, abs or play sports. No weight training.</p>
                </div>
                <div className="rule-item">
                    <p><b>Sets*</b></p>
                    <p>Each set you do, push yourself as close to failure as possible.</p>
                </div>
                <div className="rule-item">
                    <p><b>Progressive overload</b></p>
                    <p>Choose the maximum weight where you can do 6-8 reps with good form. Once you can do 8 reps for all your sets of your exercise, up your weight.</p>
                </div>
            </ul>
            <small>* Before the first set of each targeted muscle group ex. chest, triceps, back, etc.. do a warm up set doing 4-6 reps of 30%, 50%, and 75% of the weight you plan to use. You do not need to go to failure for these warmup sets.</small>
            <p>This training plan uses the <b>Upper Lower Split</b>⬇️</p>
            <p><b><i>Upper Body &rarr; Lower Body &rarr; Rest</i></b></p>
